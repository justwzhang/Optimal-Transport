# Geometric Algorithm for Optimal Transportation (OT) Map

This C++ project framework is used to help students to implement geometric algorithms for OT map.

## System

The code has been tested on Windows 10, Ubuntu 18.04 and MacOS 10.15.5, if there is any problem, please let the instructor and TA know.

## Directory Structure

``` txt
OT                -- Folder for optimal transportation map.
bin               -- Testing data and demo scripts on Windows platform.
CMakeLists.txt    -- CMake configuration file.
3rdparty          -- DartLib, Eigen and freeglut libraries.
```

## Configuration

Follow the instruction in the README.md of each algorithm folder.
